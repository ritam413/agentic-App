first prepare the env 
->mongoURI  
->DB_NAME

prepare git-ignore

install dependencies
->  express, 
    mongose, 
    bcrypt, 
    jwt, 
    cookie-parser,
    cors

create a model for your user under 
    -> models / user.model.js

create a DB folder Keep 
->  connectDB // handles connection to mongodb 

    In the connectDB
        -> take mongoose connection string and give it to mongoose.connect and return the connnection instance

create a index / server , entry point to the app 
    -> use a try catch 
        -> see if the conn was succesful i.e if the connectDB return connnection instance then listen to the APP

crete a express APP     
->> use middleware like 
    -> cookieparser , urlencoded , cors , json 
    
    -> write the routes of the authenticaton 

create a Controller 
    -> user.auth.controller 
        -> login , logout , signup 
    
    -> signup :  
                -> search the db with email parameter for duplicate entries 
                if not-> 
                        -> use bcrypt to to hash the password 
                        -> then save the hashed pssword adn create the user in db 
                        -> also return create a cookie with it and send it
                        -> return the user and success flag and cookie 
                if
                    user already exist 
    -> login : 
                -> use bcrypt.compare to compare and verify the input password with the passsword stored in the db , if yesh then proceddd
                -> sets up a cookie and logs user in 
                -> redirect to user page
    -> logout : 
                -> check if the user is logged in 
                -> if looged in 
                            -> should have cookie , 
                                    -> remove the clear the cookie 
    

-> Mount up the controller with routes
-> create route folder 
-> From App 
        -> localhost.../api/auth/ redirect to uerAuthRoutes

-> userAuthRoutes are handled in Route folder 
    -> localhost.../api/auth/signup
    -> localhost.../api/auth/login
    -> localhost.../api/auth/logout
